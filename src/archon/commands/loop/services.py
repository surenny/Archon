    Background services (the dashboard / blueprint server) are stopped by

    (closing the terminal, or an SSH session dropping) is exactly that.
    Because the child servers are spawned ``start_new_session=True`` (their
    own session), they don't receive the terminal's SIGHUP either, so they
    orphan and keep holding their listening ports. Re-raising the signal as
    ``SystemExit`` lets the registered cleanups fire and the ports release.

    Defaults to SIGHUP + SIGTERM (SIGINT already raises KeyboardInterrupt,
    which runs atexit on its own). Only installs over a default/ignored
    handler so a caller's existing handler is never clobbered. No-op off the
